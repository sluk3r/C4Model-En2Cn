## Introduction

Ask somebody in the building industry to visually communicate the architecture of a building and you'll be presented with site plans, floor plans, elevation views, cross-section views and detail drawings. In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines ... inconsistent notation \(colour coding, shapes, line styles, etc\), ambiguous naming, unlabelled relationships, generic terminology, missing technology choices, mixed abstractions, etc.
